      question: 'What are the different positions in hockey?',
      answer:
        "A player in hockey has a position. Each position has a different job. There are three different positions on your team. The forward’s job is to score goals and pass the puck to their other teammates to score goals. That’s why their offense score is usually higher than the other positions. The defense’s job is to help stop goals and pass the puck to help score goals. This is why their defense score is usually higher than other players. The goalie’s job is to stop the puck from going into the goal. It's called a save when they stop the puck. Your team’s starting lineup has 3 forwards, 2 defense, and 1 goalie.",
